This repo contains code for the solved exercises/relevant sections from the following sources.

1. [CIS194: Introduction to Haskell](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)
2. [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
3. [Real world Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
4. [C9 Lectures by Erik Meijer](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals)

I'll also try to implement all code samples in Scala just to see how different the implementation might be in Scala vs. Haskell.
