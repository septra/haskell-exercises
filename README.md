This repo contains code for the solved exercises/relevant sections from the following sources.

1. (CIS194: Introduction to Haskell)[https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html]
2. (Learn you a Haskell)[http://learnyouahaskell.com/]
3. (Real world Haskell)[http://book.realworldhaskell.org/]

I'll also try to implement all code samples in Scala just to see how different the implementation might be in Scala vs. Haskell.
